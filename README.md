# ⭐ Features

## 1. Add Expense

User enters:

- Expense name
- Amount

Example:

```text
Name: Food
Amount: 250
```

Click **Add Expense**.

The frontend sends the expense to the backend.

---

## 2. View Expenses

Display all added expenses.

Example:

```text
Food       ₹250
Travel     ₹100
Shopping   ₹500
```

The expenses are stored temporarily in the backend.

---

## 3. Delete Expense

Each expense has a **Delete** button.

Example:

```text
Food       ₹250       [Delete]
Travel     ₹100       [Delete]
```

Clicking Delete removes the expense.

# 🔄 How the Project Works

Very simple:

```text

Expenses Array
```

Example:

```text

   ↓
[
  { name: "Food", amount: 250 },
  { name: "Travel", amount: 100 }
]
```

---

# 🔌 API Endpoints

The backend will have only **3 endpoints**.

### GET `/expenses`

```text
GET /expenses
```

---

```

Example data:

```text
DELETE /expenses/1
```

# 👥 Team GitHub Workflow

We are using GitHub mainly to practice collaboration.

## Main branches

```text
main
  ↑
dev
  ↑
feature branches
```

### `main`

Stable version of the project.

**Don't directly work on `main`.**

### `dev`

Where everyone's completed features are combined.

### Feature branches

Each person creates their own branch.

Examples:

```text
feature/frontend
feature/backend
feature/expense-ui
feature/api
```

---

# 🚀 Basic Git Workflow

## First time

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <github-repo-url>
```

Enter the project:

```bash
cd expense-tracker
```

Go to `dev`:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

---

## Start working

Create your feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/frontend
```

---

## After making changes

Check your changes:

```bash
git status
```

Add them:

```bash
git add .
```

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "add expense form"
```

Push:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/frontend
```

---

## Create Pull Request

Go to GitHub.

Create:

```text
feature/frontend → dev
```

After review, merge the Pull Request.

---

# 🔄 Before Starting New Work

Always get the latest `dev`:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

Then create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

---

# ⚠️ Important Rules

### 1. Don't directly push to `main`

❌

```bash
git push origin main
```

### 2. Don't work directly on `dev`

Create a feature branch.

### 3. Pull before starting new work

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

### 4. Make small commits

Good:

```text
add expense form
add delete button
create GET expenses API
fix amount validation
```

Avoid:

```text
final changes
everything
update
asdf
```

# 🧑‍💻 Suggested Team Division

For 3 people:

### Person 1 — Frontend

```text
HTML
CSS
Frontend JavaScript
```

Branch:

```text
feature/frontend
```

### Person 2 — Backend

```text
Node.js
Express
API endpoints
```

Branch:

```text
feature/backend
```

### Person 3 — Integration

```text
Connect frontend to backend
Test APIs
Fix bugs
```

Branch:

```text
feature/integration
```

If there are only 2 people, one person can handle frontend and the other backend.
